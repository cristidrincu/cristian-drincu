		I believe that if you truly love web development, you will try and achieve a complete developer status, as I like to call it.
		It means that you can work on developing the UI and UX, write unit tests as well as be able to manipulate data.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also believe that you must be a pragmatic programmer â€“ learn a new programming language every year, read books on emerging technologies,
		take online courses, certify yourself - be marketable and a valuable asset.
