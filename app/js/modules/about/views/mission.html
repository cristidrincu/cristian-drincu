		Since the first time I started developing projects in Macromedia Flash, I wanted to put on screen the ideas that I thought of.
		Back then, however, I turned to some other friend or person to help me bind the gap from my animations and my UI to the backend data,
		whether it was stored in XML files or MySQL.
	</p>
	<p>
		It was then that I decided my mission is to learn that as well, so I will be able to work flawlessly on both the UI and the backend.
