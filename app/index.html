										When I was done, the team of 2008-2010 consisted of Arnold, Ciprian, Simina and me.</p>

									<p>2010 brought new faces to the table, while old ones had to go. Robert and Arjana joined the team,

										magic for him, and his backend work was something similar for me.</p>

									<p>As for Robert and Arjana, I just visited them in Scotland last year and had a great time doing
